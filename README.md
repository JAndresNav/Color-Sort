Color-Sort (Data Structures using C course project)
A console-based C program demonstrating mastery of fundamental data structures and pointer manipulation. Key highlights:

Implements core structures like stacks (via stack.c/.h) and custom data types (datatypes.c/.h) to perform an efficient color-sorting algorithm.

Showcases pointer usage, modular design, and memory-safe operations through well-organized components (ColorSort.c, stack.c, etc.).

Structured for clarity and reusabilityâ€”ideal for reinforcing foundational C programming and algorithmic thinking.
